The cat command (short for “concatenate”) lists the contents of files to the terminal window. 
This is faster than opening the file in an editor, and there’s no chance you can accidentally alter the file.

With files longer than the number of lines in your terminal window, the text will whip past too fast for you to read.

 You can pipe the output from cat through less to make the process more manageable.  With less you can scroll forward
  and backward through the file using the Up and Down Arrow keys, the PgUp and PgDn keys, and the Home and End keys. 
  Type q to quit from less.
